From The Donald s promise to our allies that we can t be trusted if he becomes President, to his threat to essentially throw out the Iran nuclear deal by modifying it until it is meaningless, to his almost salivating over the thought of pushing the  big red button  and unleashing our nuclear arsenal on, presumably, the first world leader to make him angry on Twitter, The Donald has succeeded in getting himself ranked as one of the top 10 global security risks.It s gotten to the point that fifty top Republican officials have now signed a letter acknowledging that Trump would put at risk our country s national security and well-being.  According to these Republicans, many of whom were top aides or cabinet members for George W. Bush (so they are well aware that a President can be a top national security risk), Trump lacks the character, values and experience  to be President and that he would be the most reckless president in American history.  The NY Times reports:The letter says Mr. Trump would weaken the United States  moral authority and questions his knowledge of and belief in the Constitution. It says he has  demonstrated repeatedly that he has little understanding  of the nation s  vital national interests, its complex diplomatic challenges, its indispensable alliances and the democratic values  on which American policy should be based. And it laments that  Mr. Trump has shown no interest in educating himself. None of us will vote for Donald Trump,  the letter states, though it notes later that many Americans  have doubts about Hillary Clinton, as do many of us. Among the most prominent signatories are Michael V. Hayden, a former director of both the C.I.A. and the National Security Agency; John D. Negroponte, who served as the first director of national intelligence and then deputy secretary of state; and Robert B. Zoellick, another former deputy secretary of state, United States trade representive and, until 2012, president of the World Bank. Two former secretaries of homeland security, Tom Ridge and Michael Chertoff, also signed, as did Eric S. Edelman, who served as Vice President Dick Cheney s national security adviser and as a top aide to Robert M. Gates when he was secretary of defense.Robert Blackwill and James Jeffrey, two key strategists in Mr. Bush s National Security Council, and William H. Taft IV, a former deputy secretary of defense and ambassador to NATO, also signed. He is unable or unwilling to separate truth from falsehood,  the letter says.  He does not encourage conflicting views. He lacks self-control and acts impetuously. He cannot tolerate personal criticism. He has alarmed our closest allies with his erratic behavior. All of these are dangerous qualities in an individual who aspires to be president and commander in chief, with command of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. Many of the signatories declined to add their names to a similar letter in March, but say Trump s promise that Russia would be  rewarded  for hacking his political enemies and his vow to be selective with which allies we defend caused many to change their minds.John B. Bellinger III, who served as Ms. Rice s legal adviser at the National Security Council and the State Department and who drafted the letter, says that  some  of the signers  will vote for  Clinton, and some will not vote, but all agree Trump is not qualified and would be dangerous. Trump indeed would be dangerous, not just to our allies but to average Americans thanks to his proposed Muslim ban and his unabashed attempts to prop up the Ku Klux Klan by warmly embracing their support   among, of course, other things.You can read the full letter below:  Donald Trump National Security Letter by German Lopez on ScribdFeatured image via Getty Images/Scott Eisen',\n"," 'labels': 1}"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":10}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["raw_dataset[\"train\"].features"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"D_k-dPAkAAbb","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1661093905264,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":152,"user":{"displayName":"Vikram Shetty","userId":"14049890349226042699"}},"outputId":"3ad8e44e-d5a0-44cc-fea8-eeb75dc01c7d"},"execution_count":11,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["{'Phrase': Value(dtype='string', id=None),\n"," 'labels': ClassLabel(num_classes=2, names=['not_fake_news', 'fake_news'], id=None)}"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":11}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Defining Model"],"metadata":{"id":"L8OK7dpLBEsS"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification\n","\n","model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(checkpoint, num_labels = 2)\n","\n","model.config"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"2YIsc7XZBGQa","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1661093907745,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":1296,"user":{"displayName":"Vikram Shetty","userId":"14049890349226042699"}},"outputId":"47de6636-cf32-4003-d423-52b3bcb2642b"},"execution_count":12,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Some weights of the model checkpoint at distilroberta-base were not used when initializing RobertaForSequenceClassification: ['lm_head.layer_norm.bias', 'lm_head.layer_norm.weight', 'lm_head.dense.bias', 'roberta.pooler.dense.weight', 'lm_head.dense.weight', 'lm_head.decoder.weight', 'roberta.pooler.dense.bias', 'lm_head.bias']\n","- This IS expected if you are initializing RobertaForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).\n","- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing RobertaForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).\n","Some weights of RobertaForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at distilroberta-base and are newly initialized: ['classifier.dense.weight', 'classifier.dense.bias', 'classifier.out_proj.bias', 'classifier.out_proj.weight']\n","You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["RobertaConfig {\n","  \"_name_or_path\": \"distilroberta-base\",\n","  \"architectures\": [\n","    \"RobertaForMaskedLM\"\n","  ],\n","  \"attention_probs_dropout_prob\": 0.1,\n","  \"bos_token_id\": 0,\n","  \"classifier_dropout\": null,\n","  \"eos_token_id\": 2,\n","  \"hidden_act\": \"gelu\",\n","  \"hidden_dropout_prob\": 0.1,\n","  \"hidden_size\": 768,\n","  \"initializer_range\": 0.02,\n","  \"intermediate_size\": 3072,\n","  \"layer_norm_eps\": 1e-05,\n","  \"max_position_embeddings\": 514,\n","  \"model_type\": \"roberta\",\n","  \"num_attention_heads\": 12,\n","  \"num_hidden_layers\": 6,\n","  \"pad_token_id\": 1,\n","  \"position_embedding_type\": \"absolute\",\n","  \"transformers_version\": \"4.21.1\",\n","  \"type_vocab_size\": 1,\n","  \"use_cache\": true,\n","  \"vocab_size\": 50265\n","}"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":12}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Defining Tokenizer"],"metadata":{"id":"vg8XkITvBP3d"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer, AutoConfig, DataCollatorWithPadding\n","\n","tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(checkpoint)\n","\n","print(\"Done !\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"1txu0yhIBITu","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1661093911231,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":1161,"user":{"displayName":"Vikram Shetty","userId":"14049890349226042699"}},"outputId":"8290a312-1a56-4209-eb08-820ac168ffb7"},"execution_count":13,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Done !\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Batchwise Tokenization"],"metadata":{"id":"t_UGBofmBXep"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["RoBERTA's input token length is maxxed out at 512.

Russia used excessive force to storm a school in the small southern Russian town seized by Islamist militants in 2004, causing a high number of hostages to be killed, the court ruled in April. The three-day drama began when Islamist militants took more than 1,000 people hostages on the first day of the school year and called for independence for the majority-Muslim region of Chechnya. More than 330 hostages lost their lives, including at least 180 children, when the siege ended in a gun battle. It was the bloodiest incident of its kind in modern Russian history.     The case for damages was brought by 409 Russian nationals who either were taken hostage or injured in the incident, or were family members of those taken hostage, killed or injured, the European Court of Human Rights statement said in April. On Tuesday, the court said in a press release that its Grand Chamber Panel had rejected a Russian government request to refer the case and said its ruling was final.   No other actions are being contemplated by the participants in this process,  the Russian justice ministry said in comments carried by Interfax news agency.  In its April ruling, the court said the heavy-handed way Russian forces stormed the school had  contributed to the casualties among the hostages . It also ruled that authorities had failed to take reasonable preventive measures, despite knowing militants were planning to attack an educational institution. ',\n"," '(Reuters) - Highlights for U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration on Friday: The Trump administration could respond to North Korea’s latest failed missile test by speeding plans for new U.S. sanctions against Pyongyang, including possible measures against specific North Korean and Chinese entities, a U.S. official says. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warns failure to curb North Korea’s nuclear and missile development could lead to “catastrophic consequences” while China and Russia rebuke Washington for its threat of force. Trump signs a bill approved by the Republican-led Congress to avert a U.S. government shutdown and give lawmakers another week to work out federal spending through Sept. 30, with tricky issues like defense spending still unresolved. Trump pledges to uphold Americans’ right to possess guns in a speech that he uses to revisit some 2016 election campaign themes from his vow to build a border wall to dismissing Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren as “Pocahontas.” Trump tells Reuters he will either renegotiate or terminate what he calls a “horrible” free trade deal with South Korea and says Seoul should pay for a U.S. anti-missile system he prices at $1 billion. A 5-year-old U.S.-South Korean trade deal could be improved to increase access for American vehicles and deter currency manipulation but changes will not necessarily shrink the U.S. trade deficit with the Asian export powerhouse. OBAMA-ERA REGULATIONS Lawmakers, lobbyists and interest groups are making a final push in their fight over regulations enacted during former President Barack Obama’s last months in office, with the financial services industry working hard to kill a rule on retirement plans run by states. Trump signs an executive order to extend offshore oil and gas drilling to areas that have been off limits — a move meant to boost domestic production but that could fall flat due to weak industry demand for the acreage. A U.S. appeals court grants a Trump administration request to put on hold a legal challenge by industry and a group of states to Obama administration regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse emissions mainly from coal-fired power plants, rules Trump is moving to undo. In an unexpected triumph for privacy advocates, the U.S. National Security Agency says it has stopped a form of surveillance that allowed warrant-less collection of the digital communications of Americans who mentioned a foreign intelligence target in their messages.

These are my immediate priorities and they are critically important to establishing credibility and stability as our country continues to recover from one record-setting storm and prepared for yet another,” McConnell said on the Senate floor. ',\n"," 'Rachel Maddow is angry with her fellow members of the press   and with very good reason. The thing is, everyone has been railing Trump s nutty comments regarding punishing women for exercising their right to choose to end a pregnancy, and rightfully so. However, the truth is, the whole GOP agrees with Trump, but no one is talking about that. On the Thursday night edition of her show, Maddow took the rest of the press to task for ignoring the dangerous anti-woman views of almost all politicians on the right. She began: I don t know if the Beltway media sort of doesn t get this yet, or if they don t feel like reporting on it or if it s uncomfortable, or if it earns you too many enemies from people you want to be sources or friends in the future. But what we are having right now in terms of the focus of the Republican presidential race and its national media coverage right now is a farce. She reminded everyone that Ted Cruz and others are simply smart enough not to openly call for something as outrageous as punishment for abortions, and he said so at a  Women for Cruz  rally. Maddow continued:Ted Cruz is right, that the anti-abortion movement in general has learned to stop talking about that. They don t like to talk about that; they like to say that they ll never talk about that. But it is, if we re being honest here, an unavoidable consequence of what it would mean if they get their way. Maddow is right, of course. Cruz has very extreme views on abortion, and has bragged publicly about his so-called  right to life  stance. He isn t any less extreme than Trump; in fact, he may be more so, considering that he has said he d go around the Roe v. Wade decision to end abortion in America for good.Maddow s parting warning is one we all need to understand and heed:So, just a note to the national media and to the Beltway media on this subject. I know everybody s all over Donald Trump on this   what will this mean for his campaign?   but covering a story like this does not mean just writing down what people want you to say about them in the terms they want you to use. Exactly. The entire Republican Party wants to set women s rights back half a century, but nobody wants to talk about that. That is a very dangerous game to play, to ignore the facts of their positions and pretend that these other politicians are any better than the circus act that is the Donald Trump campaign.Watch the video below. Maddow s Trump comments start around the 10:50 mark:Featured image via video screen capture',\n"," '(Reuters) - U.S. civil rights activist DeRay McKesson, who was instrumental in the growth of the Black Lives Matter movement against police violence, is running for mayor of Baltimore. McKesson, who filed his paperwork minutes before Wednesday’s deadline, is among more than a dozen Democrats heading to an April primary.  The 30-year-old son of two now-recovered drug addicts, McKesson rose to prominence during the 2014 protests in Ferguson, Missouri, over the police killing of unarmed black teen Michael Brown and has become one of the nation’s best-known civil rights leaders. His distinctive blue Patagonia vest has been seen everywhere from street demonstrations in his native Baltimore to a recent appearance on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.” “I am not the silver bullet for the challenges of our city - \\u200ano one individual is,” McKesson said on Wednesday in a post on the blog publishing platform Medium.  “Together, with the right ideas, the right passion, the right people, we can take this city in a new direction.” His rivals include former Baltimore Mayor Sheila Dixon and state Senator Catherine Pugh. The city has not elected a Republican mayor in more than 50 years. Current Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said in September that she would not seek re-election when her term ends. A website set up to collect contributions for McKesson’s campaign had recorded 474 donations totaling $34,383 by midday Thursday. An alumnus of Maine’s Bowdoin College, McKesson worked in Baltimore and Minneapolis schools before moving into full-time activism.  One political observer said working-class Baltimore voters might hold his lack of political experience against him. “The profile he has now, he’s gotten from doing national work, not local work,” said Lester Spence, associate professor of political science and African studies at Johns Hopkins University. Last year, the mainly black city of 600,000 people was torn by its worst riots in a half-century following the death of Freddie Gray from injuries sustained while in police custody.    Coming amid a string of controversial police killings across the United States, Gray’s death proved a turning point when prosecutors brought charges against six officers within weeks. The first of those six trials, in which Officer William Porter faced charges including involuntary manslaughter, ended in a hung jury.  That threw State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby’s aggressive schedule into disarray, and a judge last month rejected prosecutors’ request to order Porter to testify against his fellow officers while he awaits retrial. ',\n"," 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday backed a plan to help Puerto Rico escape crippling debt and expand the economy, a move that could put a rescue before the House of Representatives within days. The House Natural Resources Committee endorsed the plan by a 29-10 vote and left intact most provisions endorsed by House Speaker Paul Ryan. The plan would empower a federal oversight board to negotiate with investors and decide what they would recover from the roughly $70 billion they lent the island. Taxpayer money will not be spent in the rescue which would prevent a bailout, Ryan’s office said in a statement on Wednesday. Puerto Rico’s Governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla praised the bill for elements to help address insolvency, protect essential services and grow the economy. However, he reiterated reservations about the broad power of the oversight board. “Puerto Ricans are Americans and our democratic rights need to be protected, just like those of American citizens living on the mainland, and the oversight provisions do not meet that obligation,” he said in a statement, urging Ryan to amend the bill before it goes to the full House for a vote.     Under the plan, investors may not sue Puerto Rico while the oversight board does its work, and all the island’s creditors could face a loss despite recent lobbying from Wall Street interest groups. Among Republicans who voted on Wednesday, more than half endorsed the rescue plan but a vocal minority warned that it would hurt investor demand for municipal bonds and force issuers to offer higher yields. “Taxpayers across the country will have to pay ... as markets adjust to this new world,” warned Congressman Tom McClintock of California. The bill, called the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act, passed without significant changes. Speaker Ryan and Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in the House, in separate statements on Wednesday touted bipartisan support for the bill. If that holds, lawmakers may guide the rescue past the Senate to President Barack Obama before $1.9 billion in Puerto Rico debt is due on July 1. Republicans may demand more concessions while some Democrats find the oversight board too punitive. Democrats also want guarantees that the island’s pension system, which has a shortfall of $40 billion, would be protected first. With the House and Senate set to begin a week-long Memorial Day holiday break at the end of this week, debate of the bill by the full House is not expected until sometime in June.

Then came so close to defaulting on America s debts that the nation s credit rating was reduced. Then nominated a reality television star and serial liar as president. Then elected said reality television star and serial liar to actually be president even after a tape was released where he bragged about sexual assault. Republican Representative Tom Rooney had an epiphany: Maybe  maybe the Republican Party is a joke?It may seem obvious to some, but even Republicans themselves are starting to question whether or not the GOP has a single good idea in years.Rooney s epiphany came after he watched how his party botched a healthcare reform bill that the GOP had spent seven years promising to pass. From start to finish, the effort was a spectacular failure. The bill itself was a rush job and so poorly constructed that an independent assessment of its effects found that it would result in 24 million fewer people having insurance while also not saving the country any money. The bill s popularity hovered around 17%. Then the right-wing section of the Republican Party actually revolted against the bill because it didn t kick more people off of insurance. Then Trump demanded the GOP prove its loyalty to him by passing the bill anyway   and nobody listened. The bill failed before it even got a vote, humiliating both Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan.Republicans, including Rooney, were shook. So much so that Rooney began saying the one thing you as a Republican are never supposed to say aloud.As the prospect of a loss became more real on Friday, the frustrations of GOP lawmakers loyal to the leadership began to boil over.

However, his behavior in recent weeks has been so completely unhinged that people on both sides of the political aisle have been questioning his mental stability. Even the sitting president did something completely unprecedented and came out and said that Trump is quote,  unfit to serve as president. Now, a Democratic congresswoman from California, Karen Bass, has done what no one has had the courage to do, and started a Change.org petition calling for Donald Trump to undergo a mental health evaluation. Bass, who had a career in healthcare prior to running for office, says of her decision to move forward with what is surely to be a controversial move regarding the other party s standard-bearer in her petition: Donald Trump is dangerous for our country. His impulsiveness and lack of control over his own emotions are of concern. It is our patriotic duty to raise the question of his mental stability to be the commander in chief and leader of the free world.Mr. Trump appears to exhibit all the symptoms of the mental disorder Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD). Mental health professionals need to come forward and urge the Republican party to insist that their nominee has an evaluation to determine his mental fitness for the job. Also, in case people had any doubt about what Narcissistic Personality Disorder is and how Trump fits the profile, Rep. Bass laid all of that out as well. From The Hill:In her petition, Bass laid out the nine symptoms of NPD, which are a grandiose sense of self-importance, a preoccupation with fantasies of unlimited success, a belief that he or she is special and can only be understood by others with a similar status, a requirement of excessive admiration, a sense of entitlement, interpersonal exploitation, lack of empathy, envy of others and arrogant or haughty behavior.Well, that definitely describes Trump s public behavior to the letter, and therefore Rep. Bass s request is completely justified. Hopefully, the GOP leadership heeds this warning and   even if it is done privately   has Trump evaluated, if for no other reason than the fact that they actually care about the American people they represent.You can sign this very important petition here at Change.org.Featured image via Joshua Lott/Getty Images',\n"," 'The EPA s response to spilling toxic water into the Colorado River was to do nothing for 24 hours. Can you imagine if a private company had done something like this? Does the EPA fine itself now? The only thing I m sure of is the EPA administrator who s responsible for this should be fired but won t be The EPA is known for its hard line on environmental offenders, but its own accountability is being challenged after its agents unleashed a disastrous toxic spill threatening water supplies in four Western states and two Indian reservations.The agency revised Sunday its estimate on the spill from 1 million gallons to 3 million as regional officials came under fire for waiting 24 hours before alerting authorities that a crew at the Gold King Mine had accidentally uncorked the orange, acidic brew now spreading from Colorado to New Mexico, Arizona and Utah. There is widespread frustration with the EPA s initial response and the lack of information coming out of the agency   the poor communication is unacceptable,  said Rep. Scott R. Tipton, Colorado Republican.  If a mining operator or other private business caused the spill to occur, the EPA would be all over them. The EPA admits fault, and as such must be accountable and held to the same standard,  Mr. Tipton said.Navajo Nation President Russell Begaye said Sunday that he will sue the EPA for  millions of dollars.  The reservation sits in the path of the contaminated water via the San Juan River, which merges with the Animas in New Mexico. We are going to make EPA pay for this,  Mr. Begaye told the Navajo Times.EPA Region 8 administrator Shaun McGrath took responsibility for the spill Saturday, but the agency is receiving little sympathy from Western lawmakers and others who have found themselves too often pleading for mercy from the EPA for less-egregious violations. Imagine what would happen if a private company caused this waste spill,  New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez said in a statement. This was caused by the EPA and the EPA should demand the same of itself as it would of a private business responsible for such a spill, particularly when it comes to making information available to the public and state and local officials,  she said.Read more: WT',\n"," 'BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the British opposition Labour Party, said on Thursday he would fight any attempt by Prime Minister Theresa May s government to use Britain s exit from the European Union as a way to turn the country into a tax haven.  Corbyn, who was speaking to a meeting of the socialists and democrats in the European Parliament in Brussels, has previously warned that the country must avoid a  race to the bottom  by slashing tax rates to attract foreign investment.   We will resist any attempt by British Conservatives to use Brexit to try and create any kind of deregulated tax haven off the shores of Europe,  he said.   ',\n"," 'Republicans always talk a big game about being  pro-life.  One of the ways they lead their clueless voters into thinking that they really care about abortions is by attacking healthcare organizations that provide the services. That s exactly what happened in Wisconsin on Thursday when Governor Scott Walker signed two bills that will block millions of dollars in federal funding from reaching Planned Parenthood.According to Yahoo News:One of the new Wisconsin rules requires the state to apply for federal  Title X  family planning grant money and to give those monies to  less controversial public entities  such as state, county and local health departments and clinics, a statement from Walker s office said.Planned Parenthood is currently the only entity in Wisconsin receiving this federal money and the funds will not be sent to the organization, the statement said. Less controversial ? The only reason Planned Parenthood is  controversial  is because the GOP has made it so. They attack the group because it is an easy target as the country s largest abortion provider. But they actively ignore the fact that only roughly three percent of the organization s services are abortion related and that federal funding does NOT pay for that three percent   it is illegal and has been since 1976.The other bill that Walker signed into law will restrict the amount of money Planned Parenthood gets back for birth control (and other prescriptions) reimbursements.The bill singles out Planned Parenthood by referring to  a covered entity that is an abortion provider.  Of the 22 Planned Parenthood clinics in the state, only three perform abortions. Planned Parenthood affiliates in Wisconsin serve more than 60,000 patients annually.This is really important because in order to truly be  pro-life  one must actively reduce the need for pregnancy terminations. One of the easiest ways of doing that is by providing women and girls with free birth control. Now, twenty-two clinics are going to have a very hard time doing this because of Walker. If these women do not have access to birth control, then this could result in a boom of pregnancies   Walker should have taken a look at Texas.Together the two laws could block more than $7 million of federal funding from reaching the clinics.  All of this proves that GOP cares less about preventing abortions and much more about punishing women and Planned Parenthood.

Would the media cover this story if a bar owner suggested a well-known attempted assassin kill Hillary? Is it a clever joke or a threat? Maybe a little bit of both? A sign outside a bar is turning a lot of heads.The message is political and timely and if you understand the context, but it could be considered a possible threat on Donald Trump.  ABC22Now',\n"," 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - Dozens of protesters gathered outside of Goldman Sachs Group Inc headquarters on Tuesday to rally against President-elect Donald Trump’s picking several former executives of the Wall Street bank for top jobs in his administration. Some of the 50 or so protesters wore swamp-monster masks in reference to Trump’s pledge to “drain the swamp” that he said Washington has become and get rid of special interests. About 20 of them brought sleeping bags, intending to camp outside 200 West Street until Trump’s inauguration on Friday. Goldman Sachs security guards sent employees and guests to entrances on the north side of the building on the rainy evening as protesters unrolled green sleeping bags on the southwest corner. In an emailed statement, Goldman Sachs spokeswoman Tiffany Galvin said the bank respects “every individual’s rights to assembly and free speech.” She declined to comment on the protesters’ objections to Trump’s nominations of ex-Goldman employees including Steve Mnuchin, Trump’s pick to lead the U.S. Treasury Department. Others include Gary Cohn, who had been chief operating officer before becoming Trump’s economic adviser, and Dina Powell, who left her position as Goldman’s head of philanthropic investing to do the same. Goldman Sachs had long been viewed as Wall Street’s most prestigious and profitable bank with so many executives leaving for high-profile government positions it earned the nickname “Government Sachs.” But in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, Goldman instead found itself blamed by politicians and activists for profiting from the implosion of the mortgage market. In response, the bank embarked on a public relations campaign to clean up its image and launched initiatives to help small businesses, prisoners and female entrepreneurs. But the string of Trump appointments has renewed some of public contempt it received during the Occupy Wall Street protests in 2011. (reut.rs/pJKyQX) Nelini Stamp, 29, an organizer with a group called Working Families, said she also participated in that movement and  Trump’s appointments drove her to come back. “We’re here to make sure that people realize that Goldman Sachs is running our government,” Stamp said. Holding a sign with the image of a swamp monster biting down on a gold bar emblazoned with #GovernmentSachs and “foreclosures,” Ethan Cantor, 25, said it was his first time at a protest. The New Jersey native said Trump’s embrace of Goldman Sachs contradicted criticism the president-elect had leveled against Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton for speaking fees she received from the bank. “He used Goldman as a dig against Hillary,” said Cantor, who said he reluctantly voted for Democratic candidates in the last election. “One good thing about (Trump’s) campaign was that it was populist. Now he’s lying to his own voters.” ',\n"," 'Bill Clinton was in Philly today and got swamped by protesters holding signs about Black Lives Matter or Benghazi. It was ugly but what was even worse is Bill decided to give the BLM protesters a dose of truth. That didn t go over too well and probably didn t win Hillary any votes. It was a squirm-worthy moment in politics  One sign read:  HILLARY IS A MURDERER  Clinton got in a heated argument with Black Lives Matter protesters as he was campaigning for his wife Hillary Clinton in Philadelphia, battling the protesters over his passage of criminal justice reform.Clinton tried to address the protesters, but they continued to yell over his answer.  Here s the thing, I like protesters. But the ones who won t let you answer are afraid of the truth,  he told the crowd to applause.The former president noted that Hillary had nothing to do with his reforms, but defended them anyways.  Because of that bill, we had a 25-year low in crime, a 33-year low in the murder rate, and listen to this, because of that and the background check law, a 46-year low in the deaths of people of gun violence. And how do you think those lives were, that mattered? Whose lives were saved, that mattered? One of the protesters yelled that Bill should be charged with crimes against humanity.  Ohohohoho!  Clinton responded. I don t know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13-year-old kids hopped up on crack and sent them out on the street to murder other African-American children,  a now visibly angry Clinton shot back.  Maybe you thought they were good citizens  You are defending the people who kill the people whose lives you say matter! Clinton continued to call out the protesters for talking over his answers.  They re afraid of the truth,  he told the crowd.  They re afraid of the truth.
